Getting Started
开始啦~~~

Before you continue, download the resources for this Swift tutorial and unpack the zip file. 
继续之前，下载这个文件并且解压。

You’ll have a folder containing all the images and sound effects you’ll need later on.
你会得到一个文件，里面有各种图片和音频，你等等会用到它。

Start up Xcode 6, go to File\New\Project…,
开启Xcode 6，然后

 choose the iOS\Application\Game template and click Next. Fill out the options as follows:
 
Product Name: CookieCrunch

Language: Swift

Game Technology: SpriteKit

Devices: iPhone

Click Next, choose a folder for your project and click Create.

This is a portrait-only game, 

so open the Target Settings screen and in the General tab, 

make sure only Portrait is checked in the Device Orientation section:

Device orientation

To start importing the graphics files, 

go to the Resources folder you just downloaded and drag the Sprites.

atlas folder into Xcode’s Project Navigator. Make sure Destination: 

Copy items if needed is checked.

You should now have a blue folder in your project:

Sprites atlas in project navigator

Xcode will automatically pack the images from this folder into a texture atlas when it builds the game. 

Using a texture atlas as opposed to individual images will dramatically improve your game’s drawing performance.

Note: 

To learn more about texture atlases and performance, 

check out Chapter 25 in iOS Games by Tutorials, 

“Sprite Kit Performance: Texture Atlases”.

There are a few more images to import, 

but they don’t go into a texture atlas. 

This is because they are either large full-screen background images
 (which are more efficient to keep outside of the texture atlas) 
 or images that you will later use from UIKit controls (UIKit controls cannot access images inside texture atlases).
 
 
From the Resources/Images folder, drag each of the individual images into the asset catalog:

Images in asset catalog

Delete the Spaceship image from the asset catalog. 

This is a sample image that came with the template but you won’t need any spaceships while crunching those tasty cookies! :]

Outside of the asset catalog in the Project Navigator, 
delete GameScene.sks. You won’t be using Xcode’s built-in level editor for this game.

Great! It’s time to write some code. Replace the contents of GameViewController.swift with the following:

[code area]

This is mostly boilerplate code that creates the Sprite Kit scene and presents it in the SKView.
For the final piece of setup, replace the contents of GameScene.swift with this:
import SpriteKit

[code area]
 
This loads the background image from the asset catalog and places it in the scene.

 Because the scene’s anchorPoint is (0.5, 0.5), 
 
 the background image will always be centered on the screen on both 3.5-inch and 4-inch devices.
 
Build and run to see what you’ve got so far. Excellent!
